**Overview** <br />
Repository for experimental data and computational analyses presented in: <br />
**Tong Wang, Qingyue Hu, Scout Fronhofer, Lois Pollack, Cation-induced intramolecular coil-to-globule transition in poly(ADP-ribose), bioRxiv 2025.** <br />
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.06.636987v1


**Hardware Requirements** <br />
The MD analysis should only require a standard computer that is able to run the commonly available software below, with enough memory to complete moderate intensity computing tasks. <br />

**Software Requrements** <br />
MATLAB R2021 or later <br />
  Special MATLAB dependency:  <br />
  After EOM, the CRYSOL executable (from ATSAS) is utilized to compute scattering profiles. <br /> 
The MATLAB code for running EOM may require a Windows OS, as it calls on remote DOS commands. <br />

**Instructions for use** <br />
You need only install the above software and clone/download the folders in this repository. Separate, more detailed README files are provided in each folder where appropriate, wherein more detailed instructions are provided. <br />
For a computer with an i5 or later processor and 16gb or more of RAM, each script should take 30 minutes or less, with most processes being completed in under 2 minutes. Please consult NAMD for an idea of how long MD simulations will take for a given computer setup. https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.14/ug/node99.html
