**Overview** <br />
Repository for experimental data and computational analyses presented in: <br />
**Tong Wang, Qingyue Hu, Scout Fronhofer, Lois Pollack, Cation-induced intramolecular coil-to-globule transition in poly(ADP-ribose), bioRxiv 2025.** <br />

**Hardware Requirements** <br />
The MD analysis should only require a standard computer that is able to run the commonly available software below, with enough memory to complete moderate intensity computing tasks. <br />

**Software Requrements** <br />
MATLAB R2021 or later <br />
  Special MATLAB dependency:  <br />
  After EOM, the CRYSOL executable (from ATSAS) is utilized to compute scattering profiles. <br /> 
The MATLAB code for running EOM may require a Windows OS, as it calls on remote DOS commands. <br />
