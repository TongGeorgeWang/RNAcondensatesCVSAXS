**Overview** <br />
Repository for experimental data and computational analyses presented in: <br />
**Tong Wang, Qingyue Hu, Scout Fronhofer, Lois Pollack, Cation-induced intramolecular coil-to-globule transition in poly(ADP-ribose), bioRxiv 2025.** <br />

**Hardware Requirements** <br />
The MD analysis should only require a standard computer that is able to run the commonly available software below, with enough memory to complete moderate intensity computing tasks. <br />

**Software Requrements** <br />
MATLAB R2021 or later is required to run MD analysis functions <br />
Some code is used from: Matt J (2025). Analyze N-dimensional Convex Polyhedra (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30892-analyze-n-dimensional-convex-polyhedra), MATLAB Central File Exchange.
